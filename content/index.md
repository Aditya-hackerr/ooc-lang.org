title: The ooc programming language
---

[ooc](https://github.com/languages/ooc) is a programming language with
  objects, first-class functions, and pink unicorns.

[rock](https://github.com/nddrylliog/rock) is an ooc compiler that
  generates C99.

## Docs

There's an [ooc
  wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Programming_with_ooc) for starters.

Then you can read [the ooc
  language](https://github.com/nddrylliog/the-ooc-language) by [@nddrylliog](https://twitter.com/)

The [official documentation](http://docs.ooc-lang.org/) is still a bit
  sparse. Sorry!
