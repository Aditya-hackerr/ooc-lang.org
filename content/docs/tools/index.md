## Frequently used ooc tools

There are some tools you should know about when you start looking into ooc.

 1. [rock](/docs/tools/rock/) is the ooc compiler. In most cases,
   you will use it to generate C sources and executables from your ooc sources.

 2. [sam](/docs/tools/sam/) helps you to keep all your libraries together and up-to-date.
   It's also able to resolve dependencies without any hassle.
