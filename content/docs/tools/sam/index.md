## About sam

[sam][] is a companion to [rock][] that acts as:
  
  * a minimal package and dependency manager for ooc projects. It operates
    similarly to [homebrew](https://brew.sh) for OS X, but in a much more
    minimal way.
  * a minimal code checker, that can be integrated with a [text
    editor][editors] to report syntax errors, for instance.
  * a minimal test runner, used to test [rock][] and its SDK.
  * a minimal assertion library that provides `describe` and `expect`.

These docs contain:

  1. An [Introduction](intro/) that describe how to install sam and keep it
  up-to-date.
  2. A primer on [Package management](package-management/), ie. how to install
  packages, update them, create your own packages and submit them for inclusion
  in sam's grimoire.
  3. A quick rundown of sam's [Code checking](code-checking/) features
  4. A guide on [Writing and running tests](testing/) with sam.

If you're looking into a narrative-based approach to ooc tools, head over
to the [tutorial][], which explains quite a bit about sam.
