## The ooc language in a few chapters

The language has grown over the years, but it's still relatively tidy.
Here's a list of sections of the language documentation:

 1. The [Values](/docs/lang/values/) chapters talks number literals, string
    literals, operators, variable declarations, and a few built-in types.

 2. The [Control Structures](/docs/lang/control-structures/) chapter describes
    mundane constructs like if, else, for, while, break, continue, but also
    match.

 3. The [Data Structures](/docs/lang/data-structures/) chapter talks about
    arrays and maps, among other things.

 4. The [Functions](/docs/lang/functions/) chapter will teach you anything
    from declaring function to calling them, to using external functions
    (from a C library, for example), but also variable arguments, default
    arguments, first-class functions and a nice syntax for closures.

 5. The [Classes](/docs/lang/classes/) chapter is here to help you realize
    that ooc classes are a lot like Java classes, except when they are not.
    Constructors, inheritance, abstract methods, initializers, and even
    interfaces have found they way in here.

 6. The [Operators](/docs/lang/operators/) chapter lists various mathematic
    and logic operators, their priorities, how to overload them, etc.

 7. The [Covers](/docs/lang/covers/) chapter discusses a construct halfway
    between C structs and ooc classes, that is a major actor in making C
    libraries easier to use.

 8. The [Enums](/docs/lang/enums/) chapter goes over the last kind of ooc
    types - an enumeration of things. How to define them, use them, you
    name it. (No, seriously, anonymous enums don't exist)

 9. The [Preprocessor](/docs/lang/preprocessor/) describes what happens to
    the code before it is even compiled.

If after reading those few pages you still have questions about the ooc
language, feel free to ask on our discussion group (see
[Community](/community)).
