## Discussion Groups

ooc has a [discussion group][group] hosted at Google Groups. There probably is
no better place to ask for help if youâ€™re having trouble.

[group]: https://groups.google.com/group/ooc-lang

## IRC Channel

There is an [ooc IRC channel][irc] named #ooc-lang at Freenode. Feel free to
drop by to discuss development, or if you need support. There is not always
someone available, though, so feel free to send a message to the [ooc-lang
discussion group][group] instead (see above).

[irc]: irc://chat.freenode.net/#ooc-lang

## Wiki

The [rock wiki][wiki] at GitHub is the place to add your ooc tips and tricks,
sample code which you can check out to improve your ooc-fu, third-party tools
and more. It is also a good place to discuss development-related brainstorming,
such as proposed features.
